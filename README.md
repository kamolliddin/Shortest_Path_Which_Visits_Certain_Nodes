# Shortest Path Between Multiple Nodes in graph

** To run this code, you need open "inspect element" section from your browser and observe the results in JavaScript Console. **

You can use this algorithm to find the shortest path in the graph, when you have to cross certain number of nodes. The perfect examples for this Grocery Store Map.
Imagine you need to purchase certain items in the grocery store and you like to know the shortest path to pick all the items. 

To make this happen, I modeled the store as a graph which is shown in the following picture:
